# CS236781: Deep Learning on Computational Accelerators
# Homework Assignment 2

Faculty of Computer Science, Technion.
## Introduction
In this assignment we'll create a from-scratch implementation of two fundemental deep learning concepts: the backpropagation algorithm and stochastic gradient descent-based optimizers.
Following that, we'll focus on sequences, and learn to generate text with a deep multilayer RNN network based on GRU cells.
